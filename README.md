# AI Project Template

A high-quality, production-ready PyTorch template for building, training, and deploying compact Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on image datasets.  
Designed for rapid prototyping, reproducibility, and seamless integration with modern ML tooling.

## Features

- **Modular Codebase:** Clean separation of models, data loaders, and training logic.
- **Flexible Data Pipelines:** Easily swap between MNIST, CIFAR-10, or custom datasets.
- **Configurable Training:** Command-line interface for epochs, learning rate, batch size, seed, and more.
- **Best Practices:** Reproducible experiments, device-agnostic code, and robust error handling.
- **Continuous Integration:** Automated linting, formatting, and unit tests via GitHub Actions.
- **Docker Support:** Build and run your project in isolated, reproducible containers.
- **Extensible:** Add new models, datasets, or training strategies with minimal effort.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>

# Set up Python environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run unit tests
pytest -q
